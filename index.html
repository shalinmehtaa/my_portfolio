        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a penultimate year Chemical Engineering student at Imperial College London with a keen interest in
            consultancy and
            technology backed by a technical and analytical foundation in engineering. Through internships in different
            industries,
            I have developed a generalist skillset along with a clear vision of what I want to do in the future.
            Consultancy and
            technology are what I have come to enjoy the most and developed a genuine passion for. With the advent of
            AI, Big Data,
            rampant cyber-attacks and widespread disruption across all industries, it is more important than ever for
            businesses to
            transform themselves through innovation and implementation of new platforms, architecture and tech and I
            want to be a
            part of that endeavour.

        <h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            I have performed well academically throughout my school and university years. I got 97% in my ICSE Grade 10
            board exams
            and was the topper in my home state. I secured an A* in Math, Physics and Chemistry in A Levels and
            received an
            Academic Excellence Award from our head of school for the same. I have achieved a First (77%) in my first
            year at
            university and expect to graduate with a First as well.
